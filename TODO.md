this document records todo & status comments on the progress of this project and should be updated before taking any substantial development break. This includes updates for git commits, but also intermediate updates to note issues & updates.

## Status
- I think all the allocations and transactions and savings are working correctly (except for the stuff noted below) but i didn't look super close at anythign really to test. Added transaction log page to view logs easier.

## Known Bugs
- curreny you can over-allocate to savings goals
- transactions appear editable in overall budget but are not
- category is not displated correctly on calendar view transaction log

## Desired Features
- make it so savings goal text is editable
- make it so you can't over-allocate to savings goals
- make it so savings goals are deletable?

## TextEdit Docs
- **338pm:** Everything works except allocations from rollover -> categories. (this is not accurate i found more bugs)
